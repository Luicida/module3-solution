         The Chickens
by D. A. T.: See! the chickens round the gate
For their morning portion wait;
Fill the basket from the store,
Let us open wide the door;
Throw out crumbs and scatter seed,
Let the hungry chickens feed.
Call them; now how fast they run,
Gladly, quickly, every one!
Eager, busy hen and chick,
Every little morsel pick;
See the hen, with callow brood,
To her young how kind and good!
With what care their steps she leads!
Them, and not herself, she feeds,
Picking here and picking there,
Where the morsels nicest are. Beckon to the Chickens
by Friedrich Fröbel:
Beckon to the chickens small,
Come, dear chickens, one and all! The Pert Chicken
by Marian Douglas: There was once a pretty chicken;
But his friends were very few,
For he thought that there was nothing
In the world but what he knew:
So he always, in the farmyard,
Had a very forward way,
Telling all the hens and turkeys
What they ought to do and say.
"Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder
That your goslings you should let
Go out paddling in the water;
It will kill them to get wet."
"I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,"
He began to her, one day,
"That you wouldn't sit all summer
In your nest upon the hay.
Won't you come out to the meadow,
Where the grass with seeds is filled?"
"If I should," said Mrs. Dorking,
"Then my eggs would all get chilled."
"No, they won't," replied the chicken,
"And no matter if they do;
Eggs are really good for nothing;
What's an egg to me or you?"
"What's an egg!" said Mrs. Dorking,
"Can it be you do not know
You yourself were in an eggshell
Just one little month ago?
And, if kind wings had not warmed you,
You would not be out to-day,
Telling hens, and geese, and turkeys,
What they ought to do and say!
"To be very wise, and show it,
Is a pleasant thing, no doubt;
But, when young folks talk to old folks,
They should know what they're about." The Clocking-Hen
by Aunt Effie: "Will you take a walk with me,
My little wife, today?
There's barley in the barley-field,
And hay-seed in the hay."
"Thank you," said the Clocking-hen;
"I've something else to do:
I'm busy sitting on my eggs,
I cannot walk with you."
"Clock, clock, clock, clock,"
Said the Clocking-hen:
"My little chicks will soon be hatched,
I'll think about it then."
The Clocking-hen sat on her nest,
She made it in the hay;
And warm and snug beneath her breast
A dozen white eggs lay.
Crack, crack, went all the eggs,
Out dropt the chickens small!
"Clock," said the Clocking-hen,
"Now I have you all."
"Come along, my little chicks,
I'll take a walk with YOU."
"Hallo!" said the barn-door Cock,
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" Reminding the Hen
by Bessie Chandler: “It’s well I ran into the garden,”
Said Eddie, his face all aglow;
“For what do you think, mamma, happened?
You never will guess it, I know.
The little brown hen was there clucking;
‘Cut-cut!’ she’d say, quick as a wink,
Then ‘Cut-cut’ again, only slower;
And then she would stop short and think.
“And then she would say it all over—
She did look so mad and so vext;
For, mamma, do you know, she’d forgotten
The word she ought to cluck next.
So I said ‘Ca-daw-cut,’ ‘Ca-daw-cut,’
As loud and as strong as I could.
And she looked ’round at me very thankful
I tell you, it made her feel good.
“Then she flapped, and said, ‘Cut-cut—ca-daw-cut!’
She remembered just how it went, then,
But it’s well I ran into the garden,—
She might never have clucked right again!”. Red Rooster
by Hilda Conkling: 
Red Rooster in your gray coop,
O stately creature with tail-feathers red and blue,
Yellow and black,
You have a comb gay as a parade
On your head:
You have pearl trinkets
On your feet:
The short feathers smooth along your back
Are the dark color of wet rocks,
Or the rippled green of ships
When I look at their sides through water.
I don't know how you happened to be made
So proud, so foolish,
Wearing your coat of many colors,
Shouting all day long your crooked words,
Loud . . . sharp . . . not beautiful! Our Banta Rooster
by Ed. Blair: We've got a banta rooster at our home, 'n' papa said
Afore we had him quite a week, et he wished he was dead.
Acuse that banta when he ought to be asleep at night,
'Ll jes' begin to crow right then 'n' crow with all his might.
He crows at nine 'n' ten, 'n' then eleven, twelve 'n' one,
That banta hasn't sense enough to know when he is done.
'N' he struts around, our banta does, in daytime just as proud,
'N' when the other roosters crow, he tries to crow as loud,
'N' acts just like a little kid 'ith his first pair o' pants,
Who thinks he could do any work if he jes' had a chance,
Pa. says thet banta rooster is jes' like some man he knows,
Who works hard for a little bit, then stands around 'n' blows.
But then I like him, I do, fer he don't complain a bit,
'N' when I feed the chicks, you bet he gets his share of it.
'N' if the great big chickens try to crowd him he will fight,
'N' the way he makes the feathers fly is jes' a perfect sight,
It takes a lot o' fightin', but he usually has his way,
'N' that's a whole lot more 'n' most the little folks can say. The Hens
by Elizabeth Madox Roberts: The night was coming very fast;
It reached the gate as I ran past.
The pigeons had gone to the tower of the church
And all the hens were on their perch,
Up in the barn, and I thought I heard
A piece of a little purring word.
I stopped inside, waiting and staying,
To try to hear what the hens were saying.
They were asking something, that was plain,
Asking it over and over again.
One of them moved and turned around,
Her feathers made a ruffled sound,
A ruffled sound, like a bushful of birds,
And she said her little asking words.
She pushed her head close into her wing,
But nothing answered anything.
